# Ruby Array Iterations Lab

In this lab, we are going to be doing 3 iterations inside of `iteration.rb`. 

The first iteration will be a method named `two_each_their_own` and use the `each` iteration on an array of numbers and add 2 to each number. HINT: Remember `each` doesn't mutate an array, so if you want to save the changes and return them you have to find a way to save your changes!

The next, you will do the exact same thing in a function called `map_the_grid`,  using `map` instead. You *could* copy/paste and replace `each` with `map`, however try to solve with map *without* storing in a new array! HINT: Emphasis on `!`

The third you will update your card collection by getting rid of all the doubles with a method called `collect_them_all` which takes an argument of an array and removes any duplicate entries. HINT 1: You can chain methods together with periods (ex: array.each_with_index.map ) to use multiple methods on an array and keep tidy code. HINT 2: Ruby has many uniq methods and characteristics. Do some self-teaching and see if you can find some Ruby magic to make your life easier!.
