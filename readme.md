Ruby Array Iterations Lab
This guide assumes you have Ruby installed on your machine, a text editor, and a Github account already in place.

In this lab, we are going to be doing 3 iterations inside of iteration.rb.

The first iteration will be a method named two_each_their_own and use the each iteration on an array of numbers and add 2 to each number. HINT: Remember each doesn't mutate an array, so if you want to save the changes and return them you have to find a way to save your changes!

The next, you will do the exact same thing in a function called map_the_grid, using map instead. You could copy/paste and replace each with map, however try to solve with map without storing in a new array! HINT: Emphasis on !

The third you will update your card collection by getting rid of all the doubles with a method called collect_them_all which takes an argument of an array and removes any duplicate entries. HINT 1: You can chain methods together with periods (ex: array.each_with_index.map ) to use multiple methods on an array and keep tidy code. HINT 2: Ruby has many uniq methods and characteristics. Do some self-teaching and see if you can find some Ruby magic to make your life easier!.

Installation
To get started, fork this lab to your GitHub account, copy the repo url, then in your terminal enter:

git clone {repo url}
This will create a repository in your github and download your repo to your local machine so you can start working on it. When you solved all test cases follow thes steps:

git add .
This will add all files in your current directory to be committed to Github.

git commit -m "Done."
This will commit the changes you made and ready them to be pushed to Github. The `-m "Done."' part will add a message expalaining your commit.

git push
This will push your changes to the associated Github repo.
